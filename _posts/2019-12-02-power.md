## Motivation

A common research objective is to demonstrate that two measurements are
highly correlated.  
For example,  
**A measurement**: reflect the severity of disease but is difficult or
costly to collect.  
**B measurement**: easier to collect and potentially related to
measurement A.  
Thus, if there is strong association between A and B, a cost effective
strategy for diagnosis may be to collect measurement B instead of A.

## Power Calculation

**Power** is the probability that the study will end in success when the
true underlying correlation is, in fact, greater that 0.8

Recall that, a type II error is made if we fail to reject the null
hypothesis when in fact the null hypothesis is false

Thus, power = 1 - Type II error (Î²)

In this blog, we will estimate power for different combinations of
sample size and the true population correlation

Let the sample size be 25, 50, 75, and 100. Let the population
correlation range from 0.8 to 0.95.

| Correlation |  A  |  B  |
|-------------|:---:|:---:|
| A           |  1  | rho |
| B           | rho |  1  |

First, we generate a vector of random values from an N-dimensional
multivariate normal distribution given some mean vector and covariance
matrix

For instance, if we set N = 10, the generated data would be like this

    ##              [,1]        [,2]
    ##  [1,] -1.98630078 -1.88018692
    ##  [2,] -1.08606909 -2.96877559
    ##  [3,]  0.15626669 -0.95789487
    ##  [4,] -0.16431225  0.08264868
    ##  [5,]  1.65431451  0.65172155
    ##  [6,]  0.48730551  0.85109515
    ##  [7,]  0.43559321  0.71010025
    ##  [8,]  0.01193761  0.26670785
    ##  [9,] -1.95107450 -1.92285104
    ## [10,] -0.80914405 -1.09479418

Take 5000 simulations, **power** is the proportion of the time that the
true underlying correlation between A and B is greater than 0.8

Our hypothesis is:  
H<sub>0</sub> : p&lt;=0.8  
H<sub>1</sub> : p&gt;0.8

``` r
generate_plot <- function(N){
power=rep(NA)
N
null_correlation <- 0.8
R <- 5000
mu <- c(0,0)

for (j in 1:16){
  sigma <- array(c(1,0.79+0.01*j,0.79+0.01*j,1), c(2,2))
  detect <- rep(NA, R)
  for(i in 1:R){
  data <- rmvnorm(N, mean = mu, sigma = sigma)
  results <- cor.test(x = data[,1], y = data[,2], alternative = "greater")
  detect[i] <- results$conf.int[1] > null_correlation
  }
  power[j] <- mean(detect)
}
lines(seq(0.8,0.95,0.01),power,type='l',col=N,pch=16,lwd=3)
text(0.87,power[8],paste0("N=",N),pos=2,cex=0.7,col=N)
  
}
```

The plot of power for different combinations of sample size and the true
population correlation is shown below

As true population correlation increases, the power(the probability that
the study will end in success) will increase.

As sample size increases, the power will will increase.

Thus, if we want two measurements to be highly correlated, we could
collect measurements on more individuals or choose measurements with
larger true population correlation.
