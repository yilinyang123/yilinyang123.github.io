Rule:
-----

start with $1, and keep betting the same until you lose. When this
occurs, double the size of bet for the next spin. This way, in case you
win, you will recover the money you lost on the previous round, and win
something extra. If keeping on losing, keep on doubling your bet. As
soon as you win, you should restart and bet $1 for the next spin.

The codes above simulates a series of roulette plays that continue
until  
the player budget drops to zero (the player has lost all their money)  
the player has reached winning threshold of $300  
the casino play limit is reached

Possible Outcome
----------------

![](https://yilinyang123.github.io/assets/img/writeup1_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

There are different patterns for the game. One may soon lose all his
money(black line), he may win a lot at the first beginning and suddenly
lose all his moeny(red line) and he may also keep on winning and get 100
earning(blue & green line).

Simulation
----------

Let’s repeat the process for 10000 times to determine the performance
for Martingale’ Strategy.

``` r
#Simulation
walk_out_money <- rep(NA, 10000)
for(j in seq_along(walk_out_money)){
  walk_out_money[j] <- one_series(B = 200, W = 300, L = 1000, M = 100) %>% get_last
}
```

``` r
# Walk out money distribution
hist(walk_out_money, breaks = 100,xlab="walk-out money",main='histogram for 1000 simulations')
```

![](https://yilinyang123.github.io/assets/img/writeup1_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

We could see that about half of the time that the player will lose all
his money and half of the time that the player will reach the winning
threshold of $300. There is no 1000-plays before either going broke or
reaching the winning threshold of $300).

``` r
# Estimated probability of walking out with extra cash
mean(walk_out_money > 200)
```

    ## [1] 0.5098

``` r
# Estimated earnings
mean(walk_out_money - 200)
```

    ## [1] -47.0411

The probability that the player will win money is 51.13%. Additionally,
the average earning for the simulation is -46.5862. Thus, the Martingale
strategy actually resulted in an average loss.

Change Starting Budget
----------------------

Let’s set the starting budget B to be 50 to 300 and calculate the
average earning for 1000 simulations

![](https://yilinyang123.github.io/assets/img/writeup1_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png) For
budget in range (50,300), the average earning will decrease at first and
then increase.

Change Winnings Threshold
-------------------------

Let’s set the winnings threshold W to be 250 to 350 and calculate the
average earning for 1000 simulations.

![](https://yilinyang123.github.io/assets/img/writeup1_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png) For
winnings threshold in range (250,350), there is a decreasing trend for
average earning. As people get more greedy, it is very possible that
they will end up losing more moeny.

Change Time Threshold for Stopping
----------------------------------

Let’s set the time threshold for stopping to be 10 to 300 and calculate
the average earning for 1000 simulations.

![](https://yilinyang123.github.io/assets/img/writeup1_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png) Since
the average number of plays is around 200, I set the L in range(10,300)
and there is a decreasing trend for average earning.

Change Casino’s Maximum Wager
-----------------------------

Let’s set the Casino’s maximum wager to be 50 to 300 and calculate the
average earning for 1000 simulations.

![](https://yilinyang123.github.io/assets/img/writeup1_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png) For
Casino Wager Limit in range (50,300), there is an increasing trend at
first, after 100, there is no obvious pattern about how casino wager
limit would affect average earning. After this point, the casino wager
limit may not be an important factor to stop the game.

Average Number of Plays
-----------------------

    ## [1] 200.8133

![](https://yilinyang123.github.io/assets/img/writeup1_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

The average number of plays is around 200. For 10000 simulations, most
of the number of plays would fall into the range (0,400)

Limitation & Simplification
---------------------------

The simulation involves a computer with higher memory and processor
speed.

For budget threshold, it may change during the play. For example,if one
win a lot of money over several plays, he may not want to stop at 300
since people are greedy. Since the house will always end up winning
eventually, the casino may not set a certain wager limit for play.
